        <h2>Understanding Hospice Care: How DNK Health Hospice Consulting Supports Families and Healthcare Providers
</h2>
            <p>When a loved one is nearing the end of their life, the focus of care often shifts from treatment to comfort.  <a href="http://dnkhealth.com/"style="color: aqua;">Hospice care</a> is a critical part of this process, providing emotional, physical, and spiritual support to patients and their families.

            <h2>What Is Hospice Care?</h2>
            <p>Hospice care is a specialized form of care designed to provide comfort to patients who are in the final stages of a terminal illness. Unlike curative treatments, which focus on fighting and controlling diseases,  <a href="http://dnkhealth.com/"style="color: aqua;">hospice</a> care focuses on improving the quality of life for patients by addressing their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs.

The goal of hospice is not to extend life artificially but to ensure that patients can live their final days as comfortably and with as much dignity as possible. Hospice care can be provided in various settings, including at home, in hospitals, nursing homes, or in specialized hospice care facilities.
